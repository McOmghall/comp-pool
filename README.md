comp-pool
=========

A webpage with a tagging-per-topic, last-updated-on-top, real time forum.

It allows distribution of computing jobs (in javascript) to a hive of web clients and will allow users to send their own jobs to the hive once the multiple security issues are adressed.

It has nothing to do with pool cleaning appliances.
