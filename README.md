comp-pool
=========

This Sinatra-based REST service allows distribution of computing jobs (in javascript) to a hive of web clients and will allow users to send their own jobs to the hive once the multiple security issues are adressed.

We also offer tagging-per-topic, last-updated-on-top, real time forum thread resources because I liked google wave.

It has nothing to do with pool cleaning appliances. Yet.
