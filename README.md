comp-pool
=========

This node.js REST service allows distribution of computing jobs (in javascript) to a hive of web clients and will allow users to send their own jobs to the hive once the multiple security issues are adressed. Methods to try, server-side, the integrity and correcteness of job results are also provided.

It has nothing to do with pool cleaning appliances. Yet.


###### History ######

It was firstly planned to be a Sinatra-based service, but the node.js ability to allow users to execute code server side made us to finally choose it.
